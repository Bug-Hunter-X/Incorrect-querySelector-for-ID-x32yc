This repository contains an example of an uncommon error in HTML that can be tricky to debug. The error involves using querySelector to select an element by ID. The querySelector method doesn't require the # symbol to specify an ID. The bug.html file shows the erroneous code, and the bugSolution.html file demonstrates the correct way to do it using getElementById or querySelector with the correct syntax.
